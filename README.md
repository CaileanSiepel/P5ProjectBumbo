## Version control
This part is dedicated to how we use version control and how we manage our codebase. We use git as our version control system and github as our remote repository.

### Github
We use github to store our codebase since its a fimiliar environment for all team members. Github also provides a good way to manage pull requests and gives a clear overview of the branches. 

### Pull requests
Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase. This allows a team member to review the changes and discuss any potential modifications before merging into the main branch. Code reviews will mainly be done by the project leader but occasinally by other team members.

## Coding guidelines
This part is dedicated for our coding conventions and guidelines.
